Do you think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different  customers or products? 

A: The mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different customers or products because different products have a different number of customers leaving a different number of reviews. Similarly, different customers have a different number of reviews on different products than other customers. The mean helpfulness value can be skewed depending on the total number of helpfulness votes per customer or product as well as the potential outliers.
