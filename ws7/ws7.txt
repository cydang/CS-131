When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
The manner in which the author describes how to open combination padlocks is as simple as it gets.  <br /> <br />Just follow the steps and you will almost nearly get there. You still need a fair bit of luck and as always with opening locks in the improper way, patience is the key. <br /> <br />If you can understand basic concepts then im sure this book will be an easy read. <br /> <br />Great alternative if you're free, nothing planned for the day and the TV shows suk.
The writing style is clumsy and sometimes annoying, but the content is pure gold.  I used the instructions it gives to open my first combination lock (my brother had lost the combination) within an hour of opening the book.  The next two locks took 35 minutes each.  Not very difficult at all.
it really says what it is! This book has everthing you need to know about combination locks. very useful if you are forgetfull or have a family member who is.
